        * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
        * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
            * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

        [Intro]
        Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again

        [Verse]
        Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
        You can never check me
        Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
        Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
        Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97
        Whoa, very important and very pretentious
        When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
        Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
        Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
        I wanna see my niggas go insane
        You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
        You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
        You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
        I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
        I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
        I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
        But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
        I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
        Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
        This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
        They just mad cause I got the midas touch
        You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
        Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
        I know that you gotta be a thug for her
        This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
        Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
        Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
        I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
        And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
        Make sure you hit him with the prenup
        Then tell that man to ease up
        I did another one, I did another one
        You still ain't did shit about the other one
        I got the drink in me goin' back to back
        Yeah, goin' back to back
        I got the drink in me goin' back to back
        Yeah, I'm goin' back to back
        I don't wanna hear about this ever again
        Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
        Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"
        I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event
        Oh, you need better seatin'
        I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
        The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
        Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
        Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
        Please, please do not let these niggas near me
        Please, think before you come for the great one
        Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
        Please, somebody stop me
        I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
        I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
        Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
        They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
        Yeah, they want it back to back
        They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
        I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga
